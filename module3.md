# Software development models
## classification
1. predictive: after specify the requirements, no changes till the product release.
2. adaptive: release a product at short notice, then adjust based on feedback to release second product.
- models are usually somewhere in between.
1. incremental: start on some part of product, and add more feature untill it finish.
2. iterative: finish something simpler, and build more complex next iterative.
- models can have both.

# Waterfall model

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_waterfall_model.htm  

1. If there is a problem, go back to previous phases. The later you find the bug, cost more to fix.
2. know requirements well so they don't have to change in later phases.
3. for predictable work. for team has experience building similar software.
4. pros: 
    1. simple
    2. predictability
    3. efficient
5. cons: 
    1. not flexible for change
    2. first release takes a long time

# V model

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-model  

1. emphasis on validation earlier in the process.
2. pros: earlier detecation if potial defects
3. cons: mopre upfront work

# Sashimi model
1. similar to Waterfall, but you can start a phase before previous phase ends (overlapping the phases).
2. to shorten the time or for resource utilization.
3. pros:
    1. shorten development time
    2. different people can start working without waiting
    3. can do a learnign spike early
4. cons: may result in rework

# Incermental modeles
1. build in parts, multiple mini models for each increment.
2. may overlap.
3. pros:
    1. deliver value earlier
    2. get feed back and changes between increments
4. cons: may result in rework and cost more
